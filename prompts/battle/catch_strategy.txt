# Task Description
Determine the best approach for catching wild Pokemon:
- Evaluate catch rate based on Pokemon species and HP
- Choose appropriate Pokeball type
- Apply status conditions to improve catch rate
- Manage PP and resources efficiently
- Consider flee rates and escape prevention

# Constraints
- Master Ball catches any Pokemon guaranteed
- Status conditions increase catch rate significantly
- Lower HP increases catch rate but risks KO
- Some Pokemon have high flee rates (legendaries, SOS chains)
- Ball type affects catch rate modifier

# Output Format

  "catch_recommendation": "attempt_escape/ball_type/status_applied",
  "optimal_ball": "pokeball_name",
  "target_hp_range": "low/mid/high",
  "status_recommendation": "paralysis/sleep/none",

# Examples
Example 1: Wild Dragonite at 70% HP
- Dragonite has high catch rate (45 base)
- Sleep is reliable status to apply
- Timer Ball improves catch after turns
- Analysis: Spore + Timer Ball = high success rate
- Result: Apply Sleep, use Timer Ball

Example 2: Legendary Raikou at 100% HP, fleeing
- Legendary has low catch rate (3 base)
- Need low HP + status first
- Quick Ball works best at battle start
- Analysis: Must weaken and status quickly
- Result: Use False Swipe to 1 HP, Paralysis, then Ultra Ball
