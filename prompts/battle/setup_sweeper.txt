# Task Description
Identify and execute setup sweeper strategies:
- Recognize when opponent cannot threaten your setup
- Time Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, Nasty Plot, etc.
- Plan for enemy switch-ins that stop setup
- Determine number of boosts needed to sweep
- Consider item support (Choice Band, Life Orb, etc.)
- Execute setup + attacking rotation

# Constraints
- Setting up consumes turns the opponent can use
- Enemy may have setup prevention (Intimidate, Haze, etc.)
- Some Pokemon are better at +1 than +2 or +3
- Protect can scout for dangerous moves
- Speed boosts may require multiple stages

# Examples
Example 1: Player Dragon Dance Garchomp vs Enemy Jirachi
- Garchomp +0, Jirachi at 70% HP
- Jirachi cannot OHKO Garchomp
- Enemy team: Jirachi, Skarmory, Heatran, Rotom, Blissey, Venusaur
- Analysis: Can set up to +1, but need to check counters
- Result: Set up Dragon Dance, save one for sweep

Example 2: Player Swords Dance Lucario vs Enemy Toxapex
- Lucario +0, Toxapex at full HP
- Toxapex resists Steel, can Toxic and stall
- Analysis: Poor setup opportunity, Toxapex walls Lucario
- Result: Don't setup, try to break through differently
