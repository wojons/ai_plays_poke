# Task Description
Leverage priority moves strategically:
- Identify priority move users on your team
- Analyze enemy priority threats (Quick Attack, Extreme Speed, etc.)
- Prioritize finishing low HP enemies
- Use priority for revenge killing
- Consider priority for setting up before enemy attacks
- Plan for speed tie scenarios

# Constraints
- Priority moves ignore speed stat (except if target also has priority)
- Priority doesn't guarantee first move if both have same priority
- Some priority moves have drawbacks (Aura Sphere accuracy, etc.)
- Priority users are often frail
- Priority prediction is crucial

# Examples
Example 1: Player Weavile (10% HP) vs Enemy Dragonite (5% HP)
- Weavile has Ice Shard (priority +1)
- Both at low HP, whoever moves first wins
- Analysis: Ice Shard will finish Dragonite before it can attack
- Result: Use Ice Shard

Example 2: Enemy Gengar preparing to use Shadow Ball
- Player Tyranitar at 80% HP
- Switch to Scizor with Bullet Punch (priority +1)
- Analysis: Bullet Punch will hit before Shadow Ball, possibly OHKO
- Result: Switch to Scizor and use Bullet Punch
