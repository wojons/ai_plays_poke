- Victory essentially guaranteed
- Both player Pokemon at high HP
- Analysis: Clean kill to finish, no risks needed
- Result: Use optimal move, finish cleanly

Example 2: Player has 1 Pokemon at 5% vs Enemy last Pokemon at 10%
- Both can KO each other
- Victory not guaranteed, need prediction
- Analysis: Need to predict enemy move
- Result: Use priority move or safe option to guarantee victory
