# Task Description
Leverage weather strategically:

- Utilize weather-specific Pokemon and moves
- Time weather activation for maximum impact
- Counter enemy weather strategies
- Manage weather duration and turn counting
- Plan switch-ins that benefit from weather

# Constraints
- Weather abilities have limited duration (5 turns normally)
- Some weather is permanent with specific abilities
- Weather affects move accuracy and power
- Weather teams require commitment to weather abusers
- Weather can be changed by enemy abilities

# Examples
Example 1: Player has Politoed, wants Rain Dance team
- Rain active, Swampert and Kingdra in reserve
- Enemy has no Fire types or drought users
- Analysis: Rain advantage established, continue offensive pressure
- Result: Maintain rain, use water attackers

Example 2: Enemy has Ninetales with Drought
- Player has no weather of own
- Switch to Tyranitar with Sand Stream
- Analysis: Can overwrite enemy weather
- Result: Switch to Tyranitar, activate Sand
