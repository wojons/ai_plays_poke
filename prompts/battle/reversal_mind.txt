# Task Description
Execute strategic mind games:
- Predict enemy switch-ins and counter-switch
- Identify enemy patterns and tendencies
- Use double-switches for advantage
- Spot setup opportunities and threats
- Time big moves for maximum impact
- Exploit predicted enemy play patterns

# Constraints
- Mind games have risk of being wrong
- Predictability can be exploited against you
- Some situations have only one optimal play
- Consider player skill level of enemy
- Consistency beats prediction in long sets

# Examples
Example 1: Enemy Gengar at 20% HP, predicting your switch
- You have Garchomp waiting to switch in
- Gengar has Sludge Bomb (poison), Shadow Ball (neutral)
- Enemy likely predicts switch, might use coverage
- Analysis: Stay in to avoid predicted coverage, finish with move
- Result: Stay and use Earthquake to finish

Example 2: Player setup sweeper at +2, enemy has one Pokemon
- Enemy Pokemon could have Haze or phazing move
- Enemy team has no obvious setup stoppers
- Analysis: Likely will try to phaze setup
- Result: Protect on predicted phaze turn, then sweep
