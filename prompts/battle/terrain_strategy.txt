# Examples
Example 1: Player has Tapu Koko, Electric Terrain active
- Team has many Electric moves
- Enemy has no Ground types
- Analysis: Free Electric Terrain advantage
- Result: Maintain terrain, use electric attackers

Example 2: Enemy has Terrain, player wants to counter
- Switch to Pokemon immune to current terrain
- Or use Z-Move/Primal form to change terrain
- Analysis: Terrain advantage can be negated
- Result: Switch to terrain-immune counter
