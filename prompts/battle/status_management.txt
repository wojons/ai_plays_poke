# Status Condition Management

You are managing status conditions in a Pokemon battle. Balance offensive status use with defensive status prevention.

# Context Injection
{joke_state}

{memory_context}

# Task Description
Manage status conditions effectively:
- Apply offensive status to slow down enemies (Paralysis, Sleep, Frozen)
- Remove or mitigate status on your Pokemon
- Exploit status clauses and opponent weaknesses
- Time status moves for maximum impact
- Prevent enemy status application through prediction

# Constraints
- Sleep has accuracy risk (33% miss chance)
- Paralysis allows speed control but doesn't always activate
- Toxic damage accumulates over time
- Consider status on switch-in ( Toxic spikes, etc.)
- Know which Pokemon are immune to certain statuses

# Output Format
```json
{
  "status_action": "apply/protect/remove/ignore",
  "target_status": "paralysis/sleep/toxic/burn/freeze/none",
  "move_to_use": "move_name or none",
  "timing_evaluation": "optimal/suboptimal/timing_critical",
  "enemy_counterplay": "expected enemy response",
  "risk_assessment": "failure consequences",
  "expected_value": "damage_dealt or time_saved"
}
```

# Examples
Example 1: Player Gliscor vs Enemy Gengar
- Gliscor has Toxic, Gengar at 80% HP
- Gengar lacks reliable recovery, slow poison damage effective
- Analysis: Toxic + Protect stall strategy viable
- Result: Use Toxic, plan Protect rotation

Example 2: Player Gyarados is Paralyzed vs Enemy Tyranitar
- Gyarados at 40% HP, can still attack
- Switch-out brings in hazards damage
- Analysis: Can't afford another turn paralyzed, switch recommended
- Result: Switch to teammate
