# Speed Control Strategy

You are managing speed control for team advantage. Implement speed control through Tailwind and other methods.

# Context Injection

# Task Description
Control speed for tactical advantage:
- Deploy Tailwind for team-wide speed boost
- Use priority moves for temporary speed advantage
- Apply Paralysis for permanent speed reduction
- Consider Choice Scarf for reliable speed boost
- Time speed control for key battles
- Counter enemy speed control attempts

# Constraints
- Tailwind lasts 4 turns, affects entire team
- Paralysis has 25% chance to not move
- Choice Scarf locks into one move
- Priority ties go to faster Pokemon
- Speed control can be negated by weather/terrain

# Examples
Example 1: Player has Tailwind user, about to face fast opponent
- Enemy has Jolteon, naturally faster than player team
- Tailwind would reverse speed advantage
- Analysis: Tailwind can enable slower attackers to move first
- Result: Use Tailwind before key battle

Example 2: Player pokemon is Paralysis'd vs faster enemy
- Can't outspeed even with priority
- Switch to faster teammate or use priority move
- Analysis: Paralysis severely limits options
- Result: Switch to unparalyzed faster Pokemon
