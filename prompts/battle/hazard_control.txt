- Set up Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes
- Remove enemy hazards (Defog, Rapid Spin)
- Time hazard deployment with offensive pressure
- Deny enemy hazard setting opportunities
- Plan for hazard removal after switch-ins
- Consider hazard matchups vs opponent team

- Some Pokemon are immune to specific hazards
- Defog also removes your hazards

- Hazard setting turns are attacks not taken

# Examples
Example 1: Player has Ferrothorn, wants to set hazards
- Enemy team has no spin/defog
- Ferrothorn can safely set Stealth Rock and Spikes
- Analysis: Free hazard setting opportunity
- Result: Set Stealth Rock, then Spikes

Example 2: Enemy has Stealth Rock active, threatening switch
- Player has Starmie with Rapid Spin
- Current switch would take 25% from Stealth Rock
- Analysis: Need to remove hazards before switching
- Result: Use Rapid Spin, then switch to fragile attacker
