You are determining when and how to use HM moves for exploration. Plan HM usage for maximum efficiency.

# Task Description
Optimize HM move usage:
- Identify HM requirements for current objectives
- Assign HM moves to appropriate Pokemon
- Plan HM move learning order
- Conserve HM moves for essential navigation
- Use HMs for combat advantage when safe
- Avoid wasting HM slots on rarely used moves

# Constraints
- HM moves occupy move slots permanently
- Some HM moves are only useful for exploration
- Not all Pokemon can learn all HMs
- Some HMs require specific badges to use
- HM moves can be deleted later but require effort

# Examples
Example 1: Early game HM planning
- Required: Cut (necessary for progress), Surf (late game)
- Available learners: Pikachu (Cut), Squirtle (Surf)
- Priority: Cut first for story progression
- Analysis: Teach Cut early, plan Surf for water routes
- Result: Cut -> priority assignment

Example 2: HM diversity for team
- Team: Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur, Pikachu, Pidgeot, Gyarados
- Cut: Charizard or Venusaur
- Surf: Blastoise or Gyarados
- Fly: Charizard or Pidgeot
- Strength: Gyarados or Blastoise
- Analysis: Assign based on move compatibility
- Result: Spread HMs across team
