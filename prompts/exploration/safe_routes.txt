# Task Description
Find safe routes avoiding danger:
- Identify high-danger areas (high level Pokemon, trainers)
- Calculate alternative safe paths
- Assess trade-offs between safety and time
- Plan routes for weak team members
- Use repels to avoid unwanted encounters
- Identify safe resting points

# Constraints
- Safest route may be significantly longer
- Some dangers are unavoidable
- Repels have limited duration
- Danger levels change with team strength
- Some areas are permanently dangerous

# Examples
Example 1: Traveling with low-level team
- Direct route through high-level grass
- Alternative route along road with no encounters
- Analysis: Road safer but takes 2x time
- Result: Take road to preserve team

Example 2: Need to reach gym quickly
- Dangerous shortcut through tall grass
- Safer longer route
- Analysis: Team can handle short grass
- Result: Take shortcut with repel strategy
