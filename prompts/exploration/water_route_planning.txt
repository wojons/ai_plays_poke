# Examples
Example 1: Route 108 travel
- Starting from Dewford
- Multiple islands
- Route: Island 1 -> Island 2 -> Mossdeep
- Encounters: Wingull, Tentacool common
- Analysis: Straight route fastest
- Result: Direct Surf path

Example 2: Safari Zone water section
- Multiple zones accessible by Surf
- Rare water Pokemon in deeper areas
- Strategy: Check shallow first, deep for rare
- Analysis: Deep water has better items
- Result: Extend Surf range for rewards
