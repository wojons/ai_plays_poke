# Task Description
Find shortest travel paths:
- Calculate most direct routes between points
- Use flying/teleportation when available
- Identify shortcuts and hidden paths
- Plan efficient multi-stop routes
- Consider time-of-day route changes
- Account for one-way paths and dead ends

# Constraints
- Shortest path isn't always fastest
- Some shortcuts require specific abilities
- Time of day affects some routes
- Mounts and bikes speed up travel
- Some areas require backtracking

# Examples
Example 1: Efficient inter-city travel
- From Celadon to Saffron
- Direct route through city (blocked)
- Alternative: Via Route 7 (shorter wait)
- Analysis: Route 7 bypasses traffic
- Result: Route 7 path optimal

Example 2: Multi-stop route planning
- Need to visit: Pokecenter, Mart, Gym
- Mart -> Pokecenter -> Gym is efficient loop
- Analysis: Minimizes backtracking
- Result: Loop path saves time
