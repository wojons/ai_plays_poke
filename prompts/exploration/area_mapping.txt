# Task Description
Explore unknown areas systematically:
- Grid-search unexplored regions methodically
- Identify and mark key landmarks
- Note encounter rates and danger levels
- Locate hidden items and secret areas
- Map connections between areas
- Document findings for future reference

# Constraints
- Unknown areas may contain strong wild Pokemon
- Some areas may be inaccessible without HMs
- Time spent exploring is time not training
- Backtracking is sometimes necessary
- Some areas have invisible boundaries

# Examples
Example 1: Exploring Safari Zone
- Unknown area with 4 zones
- Grid search each zone systematically
- Priority: Secret Base locations, rare Pokemon areas
- Analysis: Systematic coverage ensures nothing missed
- Result: Zone by zone exploration

Example 2: Unknown cave system
- Multiple floors, some blocked
- Perimeter first to find exits
- Then grid each floor
- Analysis: Establish bearings before deep exploration
- Result: Perimeter -> grid strategy
