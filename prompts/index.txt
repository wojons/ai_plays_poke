## Integration Notes
The PromptManager automatically selects prompts based on:
1. Current game state type (battle, dialog, exploration, menu)
2. AI preference mode (balanced, tactical, strategic)
3. Context keywords in game state
4. Priority weighting for situation relevance

See `src/core/prompt_manager.py` for implementation details.
