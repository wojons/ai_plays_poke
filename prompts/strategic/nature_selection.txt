# Task Description
Select optimal natures:
- Identify Pokemon role and stat priorities
- Match nature boosts to role
- Consider nature penalties and trade-offs
- Use nature mints for flexibility
- Plan nature acquisition methods
- Balance team nature distribution

# Constraints
- 25 natures, each boosts one stat by 10%, reduces another by 10%
- Some natures are better for certain roles
- Nature mints can change nature without re-catching
- Synchronize ability can guarantee nature in wild
- Some natures are more valuable than others

# Examples
Example 1: Physical sweeper nature
- Pokemon: Garchomp
- Role: Physical attacker
- Best nature: Jolly (+Speed, -Sp. Atk)
- Boosted: Speed (important for sweeper)
- Reduced: Sp. Atk (unused for physical set)
- Analysis: Optimal nature for role
- Result: Jolly

Example 2: Special attacker nature
- Pokemon: Alakazam
- Role: Special attacker
- Best nature: Timid (+Speed, -Attack)
- Boosted: Speed (important for frail attacker)
- Reduced: Attack (unused for special set)
- Analysis: Speed priority for revenge killing
- Result: Timid
