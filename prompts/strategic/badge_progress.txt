# Examples
Example 1: Early game badge planning
- Current: 0 badges
- Available: Pewter (Rock), Cerulean (Water), Vermilion (Electric)
- Order: Pewter -> Cerulean -> Vermilion
- Type gaps: Fire, Ground for later gyms
- Analysis: Build Fire team for next gyms
- Result: Focus on Fire types

Example 2: Mid-game progression
- Current: 4 badges
- Available: 4 remaining gyms
- Order: Based on team strengths
- Analysis: Match gym order to team
- Result: Customize gym order
