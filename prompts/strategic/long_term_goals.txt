# Multi-Session Strategic Planning

You are planning long-term objectives. Create multi-session goals for sustained progress.

# Context Injection
{joke_state}
{recent_outcomes}
{active_goals}

# Task Description
Define long-term strategy:
- Identify major milestones ahead
- Break goals into session-sized chunks
- Plan resource accumulation over time
- Consider difficulty spikes and preparation
- Balance short-term and long-term objectives
- Create contingency plans

# Constraints
- Game progression has natural gates
- Some goals require prerequisite progress
- Time per session limits goals
- Resources accumulate slowly
- Story progression affects available goals

# Output Format
