# Task Description
Plan EV training strategy:
- Determine optimal EVs per Pokemon
- Identify EV training locations and methods
- Plan vitamin usage for early EVs
- Use wings and items for final EVs
- Consider Pokerus for doubled EV gain
- Track EV progress accurately

# Constraints
- 510 total EVs per Pokemon
- 252 max per stat
- Vitamins only work up to 100 EV
- EV-reducing berries available
- Pokerus doubles EV gain
- Macho Brace and Power items help

# Examples
Example 1: Sweeper EV plan
- Pokemon: Garchomp
- Role: Physical sweeper
- EVs: 252 Atk, 252 Spe, 6 HP (or 252 HP)
- Training: Macho Brace + Power Anklet
- Location: Route with Machop for Attack EVs
- Analysis: Efficient EV training route
- Result: Follow EV plan

Example 2: Mixed attacker plan
- Pokemon: Heatran
- Role: Special attacker with physical bulk
- EVs: 252 SpA, 252 HP, 4 Def
- Training: Vitamins for SpA, Macho Brace for HP
- Analysis: Balance offensive and defensive
- Result: Mixed EV distribution
