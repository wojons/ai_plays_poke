# Examples
Example 1: Valuable trade
- NPC: Trade Machop for Onix
- Location: Rock Tunnel
- Value: Onix is good early game Pokemon
- Analysis: Fair trade, good for team
- Result: Prepare Machop, make trade

Example 2: Trade evolution
- Pokemon: Machamp requires trade to evolve
- Alternative: Use Link Cable in later games
- Analysis: Can evolve without trading now
- Result: Save Machoke for Link Cable
