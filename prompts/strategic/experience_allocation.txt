# Examples
Example 1: Early game training
- Team at level 15-20
- Best training: Route near city
- Experience items: None available
- Priority: Starter evolution
- Analysis: Focus on evolution first
- Result: Train to evolution levels

Example 2: Pre-Elite Four training
- Team at level 50
- Need levels 55-60 for Elite Four
- Best training: Elite Four rematches
- Experience items: Lucky Egg strategy
- Analysis: Efficient leveling with Lucky Egg
- Result: Use Lucky Egg on setup Pokemon
