# Examples
Example 1: Competitive breeding
- Pokemon: Garchomp for OU
- Desired IVs: 31/31/31/31/31/31
- Method: Breed with Destiny Knot
- Parents: Perfect IV parents
- Analysis: Standard competitive breeding
- Result: 6 IV breeding program

Example 2: Hyper Training
- Pokemon: Legendary at level 100
- Current IVs: 20-25 random
- Target: 31 in key stats
- Method: Hyper Training with Bottle Caps
- Analysis: Faster than breeding
- Result: Use Bottle Caps
