# Task Description
Plan TM acquisition:

- Account for limited TMs (single use in some games)
- Maximize TM utility across team

# Constraints

- TM location varies by game
- TM compatibility depends on Pokemon
- Some TMs are more valuable than others
- TM shops have rotating inventory in some games
- Hidden TMs require special conditions

# Examples
Example 1: Early game TM priorities
- Priority TMs: TM02 (Razor Wind), TM06 (Toxic), TM10 (Double Team)
- Team needs: Status moves and coverage
- Analysis: Toxic for stall, Double Team for survival
- Result: Prioritize status TMs

Example 2: Late game TM priorities
- Priority TMs: TM15 (Swords Dance), TM24 (Thunderbolt), TM25 (Thunder)
- Team needs: Setup and coverage
- Analysis: Swords Dance for sweepers, coverage for others
- Result: Swords Dance priority for setup Pokemon
