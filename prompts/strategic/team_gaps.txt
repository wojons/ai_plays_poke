# Task Description
Analyze team type coverage:
- Document current team types
- Identify type weaknesses and resistances
- Calculate coverage against common threats
- Plan additions to cover gaps
- Consider dual typing benefits
- Balance offensive and defensive coverage

# Constraints
- Team limited to 6 Pokemon
- Type coverage trade-offs required
- Some types are harder to obtain
- Consider move coverage beyond typing
- Evolution status affects coverage

# Examples
Example 1: Team coverage analysis
- Team: Charizard (Fire/Flying), Blastoise (Water), Venusaur (Grass/Poison)
- Gaps: Electric, Rock, Ice (weak to these)
- Coverage: Good Fire, Water, Grass coverage
- Analysis: Need Electric resist or counter
- Result: Add Ground or Electric type

Example 2: Late-game coverage
- Team: Garchomp, Tyranitar, Heatran, Skarmory, Jirachi, Gliscor
- Coverage: Dragon, Ground, Steel, Rock, Fire
- Gaps: Water, Grass, Fighting weak
- Analysis: Balanced but vulnerable to water
- Result: Consider Rotom-Wash for coverage
